# js_Node.js_MesageGenerator
A message quotes generator program built with Javascript, Git Version Control, and Command Line
For every time a user runs a program, they should get a new, randomized output. You can take the 
project in a couple of different forms, like an astrology generator, inspirational message, or nonsensical jokes. 
To make your program truly random, the message that it outputs should be made up of at least 10 different pieces of data
